**Personality Test**
We took a personality test  that will help us understand our colleagues and how best we can collaborate on projects. This will also help increase productivity. 

**Note Taking Discussions**
Note taking for effective learning so we don't have to keep everything in mind because that'll make remembering things difficult. For the note taking we are using obsidian and the method we are going with is the zettlekasten method. 

**Basic Linux Commands**
We learnt about basic linux commands that and how to navigate the terminal. Some of the commands that were new to us, we used the man <name of command> to get the help we needed in understanding it. Also we played a linux game "overthewire" which helps you understand when and how some linux commands work.
